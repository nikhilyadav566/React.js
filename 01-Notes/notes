//                                REACT APP NOTES



// What is React?
// React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI) for web applications, primarily focusing on the frontend.

// What is a Library?
// A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides various functionalities, which developers can use by invoking the available methods.

// React is Component-Based
// React follows a component-based architecture, meaning:

// Components are reusable pieces of code that define parts of the UI.

// A component is essentially a function that returns JSX (HTML-like syntax).

// It provides custom HTML elements that React manages internally.

// React vs JavaScript
// Feature	React	JavaScript
// Approach	Declarative (describes UI state)	Imperative (step-by-step execution)
// Reusability	Uses components	Requires manual structuring
// Efficiency	Virtual DOM improves performance	Direct DOM manipulation
// What is SPA (Single Page Application)?
// A Single Page Application (SPA) loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the page. This improves:
// ✅ Speed – No full-page reloads
// ✅ User Experience – Smooth and fast interactions
// ✅ Efficiency – Data fetching happens asynchronously

// React, along with Angular and Vue.js, is commonly used to build SPAs.

// Why Use React?
// ✔ Reusability – Components can be reused across the project.
// ✔ Readability – Code is structured and easier to understand.
// ✔ Maintainability – Easier to manage and scale projects.

// HOW TO INSTALL REACT JS 
// 1. Step1: Install node js
// 2. Step2: VS Code
// 3. Step3: Create a new Folder -> ReactFolio
// 4. Step4: Change directory to ReactFolio
// 5. Step5: npx create-react-app demoshopapp
// 6. Step6: change directory to demoshopapp
// 7. Step7: npm start

// 8️⃣ Stop the server: Press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

// Understanding React Project Structure
// 📂 package.json – Manages dependencies, scripts, and versioning.
// 📂 src/ – Contains core files like App.js, index.js, and styles.
// 📂 public/ – Includes index.html, where React mounts the app (root element).
